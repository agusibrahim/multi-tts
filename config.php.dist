// Needs to exist and have write permissions. The script will attempt to create it for you if it doesn't exist.

// Save a textual transcription of the audio?
// This will save a .txt file containing the user's text input in addition to the .mp3 of the audio that was generated.
// Filenames will be identical other than extension

// TikTok Session ID
// These seem to expire randomly after an arbritrary amount of time, sometimes sooner than the time they are valid for.
// You'll need to update this every time it expires until a better solution is found.
// To do this you will need to:
// 1. Login to TikTok in your web browser
// 2. Look for a cookie named "sessionid" - you may wish to use the Cookie Editor extension (https://cookie-editor.cgagnier.ca) for your browser to do this.
// 3. Copy and paste the value below
define('TIKTOK_SID', '581a1225c93f9b4bb9aacc49e4ebc5a9');

// iSpeech API key
// A valid key is required to use the iSpeech TTS service as their public demo website is no longer functional.
// If you do not have one, 'developerdemokeydeveloperdemokey' can be used, however, this has very limited use:
// - TTS input will be limited to a maximum of 100 words
// - Generated audio will usually contain a message telling you to obtain a valid key
